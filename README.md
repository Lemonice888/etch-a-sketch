## Technologies I Used

* CSS

## What I Learned

* How to make an internal element like div using JavaScript. In my project, I applied this concept to create the grid and line options in the sketch board.
* How to receive the input from HTML input attributes and attach it into a specific element or event. I used it to create the functionalities of the grid size and customable color options.
* And many more...
